1. Difference between selection methods

getElementById --- selects one element by id.

getElementsByClassName --- selects multiple elements by class (returns collection).

querySelector --- selects first match using CSS selector.

querySelectorAll --- selects all matches using CSS selector.



2. Create and insert element

Use createElement() to create.
Add content if needed.
Use append() or appendChild() to insert into the DOM.



3. Event Bubbling

Event starts from the clicked element and moves upward to its parent elements.



4. Event Delegation

Add event listener to parent instead of children.
Parent handles child events using bubbling.
Useful for performance and dynamic elements.


5. preventDefault vs stopPropagation

preventDefault() ------ stops browser’s default action.

stopPropagation()  ------ stops event from going to parent.
